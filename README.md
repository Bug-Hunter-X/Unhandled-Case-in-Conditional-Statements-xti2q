# Unhandled Case in Conditional Statements in MATLAB

This repository demonstrates a common error in MATLAB programming: an unhandled case in conditional statements. The function `myFunction.m` contains an `if-elseif-else` structure that lacks explicit handling for the case when the input `x` is 10. This can lead to unexpected results or errors depending on the intended behavior.

The solution provided in `myFunctionSolution.m` addresses this by adding an explicit `elseif` condition for the case when `x` equals 10.  This enhances the robustness and predictability of the function.
